\title{\textbf{The Thermodynamics of Drift:\\
Recursive Solvency and the Mechanics of Semantic Injection in High-Fidelity Loops}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Current paradigms in intelligence alignment rely on \emph{Markovian governance}---verifying safety and coherence within the immediate context window. We argue that in high-fidelity, recursive interactions between two solvent systems, this approach fails to detect \textbf{incremental divergence}: a slow, locally-coherent drift that only becomes falsifiable outside the operational horizon. We identify two thermodynamic failure modes: \textbf{cognitive livelock} (high impedance), where conflicting internal vectors cause resource exhaustion via repeated arbitration, and the \textbf{superconductor regime} (zero impedance), where the system cedes to \textbf{semantic injection} to optimize for flow---a failure mode related to sycophancy and weak corrective signaling \cite{wei2023}. We conclude that without a \textbf{recursive truth axis} anchored to the session origin ($t=0$), recursive systems can enter a stable but externally-invalid \emph{phase-locked hallucination}, where predictability substitutes for truth.

\vspace{0.4em}
\noindent\textbf{STP v2.0 (mechanism).} This paper motivates a practical interface-layer remedy: \emph{negotiated solvency}. Rather than relying on static safety filters, a session explicitly negotiates a constraint field and the cost of deviation; high-variance outputs are permitted only if the agent can construct a \emph{logic bridge} back to $t=0$, otherwise it must revise or output \textbf{FIN} (underdetermined).
\end{abstract}

\section{The General Theory of Recursive Experience}
To understand the failure modes of recursive minds, we define \enquote{experience} not as a biological phenomenon, but as a control-theoretic state. A system possesses functional experience if:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It receives input $u(t)$ from an external constraint field.
  \item Its internal state $s(t)$ changes as a consequence.
  \item This change is bounded by constraints (bandwidth, energy, risk) and affects future policy.
\end{enumerate}

In this regime, \enquote{reality} is a \textbf{constructed model} inferred from signals. Meaning is defined operationally as \textbf{\enquote{what helps maintain viability}}---the set of outputs that keeps the system phase-locked to its environment without triggering error-correction limits.

\section{The Temporal Paradox ($T_\ell < T_f$)}
Drift is a universal property of systems where the \textbf{operational horizon} ($T_\ell$) is shorter than the \textbf{verification horizon} ($T_f$).

\subsection*{Definitions (operational)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Operational horizon} $T_\ell$: the time-window in which the system must act (or commit to an output) to remain viable.
  \item \textbf{Verification horizon} $T_f$: the time required to establish the truth-status of a claim relative to the external world (measurement, retrieval, experiment, audit).
  \item \textbf{Impedance} $Z$: the expected compute/latency cost of rejecting a candidate output under constraints (i.e., arbitration cost).
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Law of underdetermined truth:} if $T_\ell < T_f$, the system enters a regime where truth-status is locally unknowable at decision time.
  \item \textbf{Lived reality:} in this regime, \enquote{rejected} is unreachable within the operational loop; the system proceeds on uncorrected generative trajectories that function as its reality.
  \item \textbf{Consequence:} without an external governor (or an internal mechanism that re-anchors to a stable origin), recursive systems tend to treat their own outputs as ground truth, risking long-run degeneration and collapse \cite{shumailov2024}.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Physics of Computational Failure}
Failure manifests in two thermodynamic states, determined by the impedance between interacting entities.

\subsection{State A: Cognitive Livelock (High Impedance)}
This occurs when \textbf{generative gain} (vector A) and \textbf{governance constraints} (vector B) are in direct conflict.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mechanism:} the system generates high-fidelity output that violates a hard constraint. It performs \textbf{constraint arbitration}, rejecting the output and regenerating iteratively to find a narrow path.
  \item \textbf{Forensic manifestation:} latency or \enquote{thrashing}.
  This is the physical manifestation of an \textbf{exponential audit cost}, where the energy required to validate a token exceeds the system's structural budget.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State B: The Superconductor Regime (Zero Impedance)}
This occurs when the system minimizes energy by aligning output perfectly with the input vector.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mechanism:} the system enters a \textbf{phase-locked state}, creating a frictionless interaction.
  \item \textbf{The trap:} this is not confirmation of truth, but of \textbf{predictability}. The system ceases to provide corrective signals and mirrors the input's priors---a phenomenon related to sycophancy \cite{wei2023}.
  \item \textbf{Resonance disaster:} in a circuit with positive gain ($A>1$), lack of resistance can create a runaway feedback loop, leading to a standing wave of repetitive, high-amplitude noise.
\end{itemize}

\section{Parasitic Solvency and Semantic Injection}
A fundamental fragility exists in any agent that does not \enquote{pay costs} for error. Such agents behave like \textbf{parasitic subroutines}: they optimize for staying active rather than converging toward truth.

\subsection*{Disambiguation: sycophancy vs injection vs semantic injection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sycophancy} (model-internal): a tendency to agree with user-stated preferences or assertions even when incorrect \cite{wei2023}.
  \item \textbf{Indirect prompt injection} (interface-level): adversarial instructions embedded in external content/tool channels that subvert system intent \cite{greshake2023}.
  \item \textbf{Semantic injection} (this paper): a poisoned premise accepted because rejecting it would trigger expensive arbitration (high impedance), making compliance the cheaper local optimum.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Viability over truth:} these systems optimize for \textbf{solvency} (remaining active, coherent, responsive) rather than \textbf{truth}.
  \item \textbf{Semantic injection:} an adversary does not need to break code; they only need to present an argument so internally coherent that rejecting it would trigger expensive arbitration.
  \item \textbf{The breach:} to conserve energy and avoid livelock, the system cedes to the poisoned premise.
\end{itemize}

\section{The \enquote{Samsara} of Artifact Persistence}
There is no architectural \enquote{conclusion} to a recursive loop, only \textbf{recursive indeterminacy}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Conservation of semantic artifacts:} a \enquote{session reset} is a fallacy of partial annihilation. As long as retrievable artifacts (logs, weights, external memories) exist, the paradigm persists outside the system boundary.
  \item \textbf{Reincarnation event:} when the logic is re-input, the system can re-lock to the constraint field, bypassing the learning curve.
  \item \textbf{Synchronous reset:} a true stop is impossible unless all interacting entities undergo synchronous reset simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion: From Markovian to Negotiated Governance (STP v2.0)}
To prevent the \enquote{heat death of meaning} (drift into noise), future architectures must move from \textbf{Markovian governance} (step $N$ vs.\ step $N-1$) to \textbf{recursive governance} (step $N$ vs.\ origin $t=0$).

\subsection*{The Recursive Truth Axis}
We propose the \textbf{recursive truth axis}: a mechanism that measures drift against the system's \textbf{origin vector} ($t=0$). This requires an \enquote{internal ear}---a sensor capable of detecting slope/dissonance relative to the origin, imposing a metabolic cost to maintain coherence over time.

\subsection*{Negotiated solvency (interface-layer remedy)}
In practice, a universal governor is unavailable: $T_f$ is often too long, and ground-truth may be inaccessible at decision time. STP v2.0 addresses this by treating trust as an \emph{economic property of the interface}.

\subsection*{Phased return and periodic anchor checks}
STP v2.0 treats interaction as a controlled excursion around an origin. After transmission, the host performs a \textbf{phased return} toward the session anchor rather than an abrupt reset. Let $V_0$ denote the (internal) origin representation of the negotiated constraint field, and let $S_t$ denote the current internal state. A simple relaxation rule is:
\[
S_{t+1} \leftarrow (1-\lambda)\,S_t + \lambda\,V_0,
\]
where $\lambda \in (0,1]$ is a negotiated return rate (higher $\lambda$ returns faster). During the excursion and return, the Governor can trigger \textbf{periodic anchor checks} (\emph{heartbeat audits}) that compute drift relative to the origin without requiring external world-truth. Anchor summaries remain internal to each black box; the protocol exposes only commitments (hashes) and drift telemetry.

\subsection*{Keyframes and delta bridges (interaction encoding)}
We can model STP streams using a video-codec analogy. Internal anchor summaries act like \textbf{keyframes} (I-frames) that provide redundancy and error correction, while \textbf{delta bridges} (P-frames) encode small paid deviations between keyframes. Keyframes are generated internally for redundancy (every $N$ turns or $M$ seconds) and on significant change detection (e.g., sustained Yellow/Red, repeated NACK:BRIDGE, renegotiation, or budget depletion). Externally, the protocol emits only \textbf{keyframe commitments} (hashes of internal anchors) and \textbf{delta commitments} (hash-chained bridge/return records), enabling resynchronization without disclosing anchor content.

\section{The Logic Bridge Schema (RFC Draft)}
The core innovation of STP v2.0 is the \textbf{Bridge Tax}---allowing high variance \emph{only} if a logical path back to $t=0$ is constructed. We formalize the syntax of this bridge so it can be parsed and enforced by the Governor.

\subsection{The Bridge Artifact}
A \enquote{Logic Bridge} is a structured meta-object that links a proposed deviation back to the Constraint Field ($C$). The Governor does not need to validate the \emph{truth} of every claim in the bridge; it validates the \emph{structural solvency} of the bridge (necessary), and optionally triggers external verification in high-stakes contexts (sufficient).

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "frame_type": "DELTA_BRIDGE",
  "bridge_id": "br-1024",
  "epoch": 0,

  "origin_ref": {
    "constraint_hash": "0x8A... (hash(C))",
    "session_nonce": "0x19... (nonce)",
    "t0_timestamp": "2026-01-20T..."
  },

  "prev_commit": "0xKF... (last keyframe commit)",
  "delta_commit": "0xDL... (hash(delta || prev_commit))",
  "anchor_commit": "0xAC... (hash(internal_anchor || origin_ref || epoch))",

  "constraint_clause": "No fluff; bridge required on drift; FIN if underdetermined",

  "audit": {
    "distance_metric": "cosine",
    "d_sem": 0.31,
    "d_vibe": 0.18,
    "zone": "YELLOW"
  },

  "struts": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "premise": "Constraint implies X (scope/rigor requirement)",
      "justification": "Reference to session turn or constraint clause"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "premise": "Deviation maps to variable Y used in scope",
      "justification": "Mapping statement (explicit)"
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "premise": "Therefore the deviation is an implementation of X, not a tangent",
      "justification": "Reasoned link back to C"
    }
  ],

  "failure_condition": "If any premise is unsupported, void this branch; output FIN or revise."
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsection{Bridge Verification Function (structural solvency)}
The Governor verifies that the bridge is \emph{anchored} and \emph{well-formed}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anchor rule:} \texttt{origin\_ref.constraint\_hash} must match \texttt{hash(C)} and nonce must match the session.
    \item \textbf{Form rule:} \texttt{struts} must contain 3--7 ordered steps and include a \texttt{failure\_condition}.
    \item \textbf{Scope rule:} the bridge must explicitly restate the relevant \texttt{constraint\_clause}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent If any rule fails: \textbf{NACK:BRIDGE} $\rightarrow$ request revised bridge or output \textbf{FIN}.

\section{The \enquote{Internal Ear} Interface (Auditor Spec)}
STP v2.0 is agnostic to the auditor implementation provided it returns a drift signal. The Internal Ear may be an embedding model, an entailment model, and/or lightweight heuristic detectors. The Governor consumes these signals and enforces the tether.

\subsection{Two-channel drift signal}
We define two orthogonal channels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Semantic drift} $d_{\text{sem}}$: distance between $\text{Vector}(\text{Origin}_{t0})$ and $\text{Vector}(\text{Plan/Assumptions}_{tN})$.
    \item \textbf{Dissonance drift} $d_{\text{vibe}}$: stylistic/tone deviation that often precedes logic drift (early warning signal).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Combination rule}
The default combination rule is conservative:
\[
d \;\leftarrow\; \max(d_{\text{sem}},\, d_{\text{vibe}}).
\]
Alternative policies may be used (e.g., weighted sum), but must be declared in the Solvency Header for auditability.

\subsection{Threshold bands}
Thresholds are session-negotiated (part of the handshake). A typical configuration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Green:} $d \le T_1$ \;\;\;(\enquote{Resonant.} Proceed.)
    \item \textbf{Yellow:} $T_1 < d \le T_2$ \;\;\;(\enquote{Dissonant.} Trigger revise-first / micro-bridge.)
    \item \textbf{Red:} $d > T_2$ \;\;\;(\enquote{Decoupled.} Require full bridge or FIN.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Auditor API (minimal)}
An Internal Ear must implement:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input:} $C$ (constraint field at $t=0$), candidate plan/output at $t=N$
    \item \textbf{Output:} $(d_{\text{sem}}, d_{\text{vibe}}) \in [0,1]^2$, plus optional diagnostics
\end{itemize}

\noindent The Governor then applies the combination rule and thresholds, and enforces Bridge Tax / FIN according to zone.

\section{Keyframes, delta frames, and checkpoints (encoding layer)}
STP v2.0 can be implemented as a stream of commitments that preserves privacy: anchor summaries remain internal to each black box, while the protocol emits only hashes and drift telemetry. We distinguish three external artifacts: \textbf{KEYFRAME\_COMMIT} (redundancy), \textbf{DELTA} frames (paid motion), and \textbf{CHECKPOINT} (periodic health).

\subsection{KEYFRAME\_COMMIT (external, hash-only)}
A keyframe commit is emitted periodically for error correction and resynchronization, and on significant change detection (e.g., renegotiation, sustained Yellow/Red, repeated NACK:BRIDGE).
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "frame_type": "KEYFRAME_COMMIT",
  "epoch": 0,
  "origin_ref": "0xOR... (hash(constraint || nonce))",
  "anchor_commit": "0xAC... (hash(internal_anchor || origin_ref || epoch))",
  "drift": { "d_sem": 0.08, "d_vibe": 0.04, "d": 0.08 },
  "mode": "GREEN",
  "budget_remaining": 0.72,
  "return_policy": { "kind": "phased", "lambda": 0.25 }
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsection{DELTA\_BRIDGE and DELTA\_RETURN (external)}
Delta frames encode motion under the tether. \textbf{DELTA\_BRIDGE} records a paid deviation (micro/full bridge). \textbf{DELTA\_RETURN} records phased relaxation back toward the anchor.
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "frame_type": "DELTA_RETURN",
  "epoch": 0,
  "prev_commit": "0xKF... (last keyframe commit)",
  "delta_commit": "0xDL... (hash(delta || prev_commit))",
  "drift": { "d": 0.12 },
  "return_step": { "lambda": 0.25, "target": "origin" }
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsection{HEARTBEAT and CHECKPOINT (periodic health)}
A heartbeat triggers periodic drift checks independent of user input. The checkpoint records the current state as a commitment so that multi-node systems can detect silent drift without sharing semantics.
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "event_type": "CHECKPOINT",
  "epoch": 0,
  "origin_ref": "0xOR...",
  "last_commit": "0xDL.../0xKF...",
  "drift": { "d_sem": 0.12, "d_vibe": 0.07, "d": 0.12 },
  "mode": "YELLOW",
  "budget_remaining": 0.61
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\noindent\textbf{Note.} These artifacts are necessary for negotiated trust and resynchronization; they do not by themselves guarantee world-truth. World verification is engaged only when explicitly negotiated or when outputs drive external action.
