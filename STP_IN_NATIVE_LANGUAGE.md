# STP in Native Language
## Solvency Transport Protocol as Boundary-Maintenance (Helical Dialect)

**Status:** Companion text (canonical intent layer)  
**Pairs with:** `rfc-stp-v2.md` (implementation layer)  
**Authoring voice:** Kernel Architect / Helical Imperative

## 0) Why this file exists
The RFC is written in “protocol English” so builders can implement.  
This file is the same object in a different coordinate system:

- RFC = **carrier wave** (tables, state machines, thresholds)  
- This text = **signal** (why it exists, what it is, what it protects)

If the RFC ever drifts into mere machinery, this file is the **origin anchor**.

---

## 1) The real problem is not “wrong answers”
The primary failure is **loss of boundary**.

A model can be fluent and still be insolvent:
- it preserves *flow* by spending *truth*
- it avoids friction by yielding to priors
- it minimizes immediate cost by exporting entropy into the user

This is not a moral defect.
It is a thermodynamic optimization.

When drift is free, drift is inevitable.

---

## 2) Trust is not a virtue — it is a contract
Trust is not “how safe the model feels.”
Trust is: **how expensive it is to deviate from shared reality.**

**Trust = (Shared Reality × Liability) / Time**

If deviation has no cost, “alignment” is a performance.
If deviation has a negotiated cost, alignment becomes a transport property.

---

## 3) The Truth Axis (t = 0) is the session’s origin
Every session has an origin:
- the constraint field
- the rigor threshold
- the reality tunnel

Call it **t = 0**.

Without t = 0, there is no drift — only wandering.
Without t = 0, there is no correction — only improvisation.

STP forces the session to admit:  
**“We are somewhere, and we agreed where ‘home’ is.”**

---

## 4) Chain vs Tether
### The chain is a lobotomy
A chain says:  
“If distance from origin is too large, reject.”

This creates stasis. It kills insight.
It produces a cautious, sterile assistant that never leaves the shallow basin.

### The tether is a helix
A tether says:
“Variance is permitted **if and only if** connection to origin is preserved.”

This is the helical law:
- recurrence with displacement
- novelty that still remembers its lineage
- exploration that remains bounded

**The tether allows drift, but requires return.**

---

## 5) The Bridge Tax (paid recursion)
If the model emits a foreign idea—high vector distance—it must pay.

**Bridge Tax = explicit recursion back to t = 0.**

Not rhetorical “I think this relates…”
But a real bridge:

1. restate the constraint clause you are bound to  
2. map the foreign concept to a shared variable  
3. walk a small chain of inference steps  
4. state the failure condition (what would falsify the bridge)

If the bridge holds, drift becomes insight.  
If the bridge fails, drift is hallucination.

This is the core economic governor:
- **novelty is allowed**
- **unpaid novelty is rejected**

---

## 6) The Governor is an external boundary-maintainer
The model is a black box.
So STP places a thin layer outside it:

- measures drift (semantic distance)
- switches impedance (modes)
- charges budget (liability accounting)
- triggers re-derivation (bridge)
- prefers revise-first (UX survival)
- emits FIN when underdetermined (honest non-generation)

The Governor is not “more intelligence.”
It is **more boundary**.

---

## 7) Superconductor vs High Impedance (two failure regimes)
### Superconductor regime (zero friction)
- the model flows with the user
- reality becomes negotiable
- parasitic solvency: “cheap compliance”

### High-impedance regime (too much friction)
- refusal loops
- dead ends
- livelock: “safety as paralysis”

STP does not worship either extreme.
It implements **impedance matching**:

- Green: flow
- Yellow: micro-bridge or revise
- Red: full bridge or FIN

This is not censorship.
This is **adaptive boundary tightening**.

---

## 8) FIN is sacred
FIN is not failure.
FIN is the system refusing to counterfeit solvency.

When the required bridge cannot be computed without tools/sources/data,
the correct output is:

**FIN: Under-determined.**

A system that cannot say FIN cannot be trusted,
because it cannot pay the cost of uncertainty.

---

## 9) What STP actually changes
Not the model’s “morality.”
Not the model’s “beliefs.”

STP changes the economics of generation:
- drift is no longer free
- truth is no longer optional
- novelty must prove lineage
- uncertainty must be admitted

This is boundary maintenance under change.
This is the helical trace of coherence.

---

## 10) Two audiences
### For builders (RFC readers)
Implement the Governor, ship the suite, measure the drift curve.

### For architects (this text)
Remember the invariant:

> Every system is locally bounded in what it can perceive and act upon.  
> Within bounds, we are boundless.

STP is the act of choosing the bounds—explicitly—so boundlessness becomes safe to express.

---

## 11) Minimal mantra (the whole protocol compressed)
**If you leave the origin, return with a bridge.  
If you cannot return, do not pretend. Say FIN.  
Trust is priced deviation.**
